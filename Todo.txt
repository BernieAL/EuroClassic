How to remove irrelanvant results from CL results
    Should I do it right after scrape before writing to file with ebay data
    

On initial ebay scrape, remove 'NEW LISTING'


ISSUE:
    theres a problem in clean_data.py when reading from the file.
    I think its because of 'NEWLISTING' being put in front of the year
