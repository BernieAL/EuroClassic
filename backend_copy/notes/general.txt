To run postgres scripts
    make sure to be in backend_copy root dir
    then run -> .\postgres\drop_tables.py
    clicking execute button in vscode doesnt work - it will say cant find db.ini
----------------------------------------
If parameterized queries not working
    check the case of what youre sending in vs whats in the db -> AUDI != Audi, AUDI != audi 

    The absolute way to standardize case is to:
        -convert user form input to upper before requesting from db
        -convert scraped data to upper before storing in db
