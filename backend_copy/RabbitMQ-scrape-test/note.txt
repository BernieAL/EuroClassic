General Idea here

-when a vehicle is not found in db a new scrape is needed - so we add veh to queue
    -add veh to queue in api
-worker(s) recieve msg from queue and then begin the scrape
-when scrape complete, worker updates queue informing scrape was complete
-another worker listens for scrape completion, then sends msg to perform email process of result to user
