VehResultPage component can be reached through url /results, with routing handling by router or through component rendering flow
-------
url requested rendering:

this would happen if a user clicks on a featured listing card with - where the vehicle listing card has its assigned vehMake and vehModel values assigned to it as props.

on click of featured listing card - request is made for /results?vehMake=<make>vehModel=<model>

the props for the specific listing card are attached as url params

the request is routed to vehResultsPage
vehResultsPage checks for presence of url params, if they exist, we know the component was reqeusted via url mapping - and we need to make an api reqeust to get the data for the requested vehicle.

params are retrieved off URLSearchParams JS object and encapsulated into object. Object passsed to fetchData function - fetchData function attaches to reqeust body in form of string

Api responds, done.
------------

In the event VehResultPage is rendered through component flow (not a url request) then we will have already rec'd props from parent. 
we double check that props (recievedData) is not empty

if not empty, send data to graphs to be rendered etc 

if emtpy, populate defaults with 0's to not break graph component
