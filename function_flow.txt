run_scrape_and_clean() 
    imports scrapeFunc from web_scrape_logic
    import clean_data from Data_clean_logic

    scrapeFunc() takes car object to go get scrape data for
    and populates the files

    clean_data() also takes the car object, cleans the data and omits any data that isnt target vehicle
    then writes to new files, one for sold cleaned_sold_data and one for cleaned_current_data
