Can we run mulitple instances of webdriver at the same time in order to hit the data sources at the same exact time.
Ex. Can we hit CL, Ebay, and BAT at the same time

The idea for implementation would be to have 3 different scripts with 3 difference webdriver instances
Then from the main app.py, import and run the 3 scripts at the same time.
